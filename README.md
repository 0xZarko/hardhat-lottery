# Test Lottery Project

This project is an assesment of my ability to develop a smart contract from scratch using Hardhat, complete with the deploy scripts (utilizing mocks), a verify utility to verify the deployed contract on Etherscan, and the testing scripts that show decent coverage (didn't feel the need to get full coverage, but it shouldn't be difficult).

I also used it to learn how to interact with the Chainlink VRF and the Chainlink Keepers, how to create and emit events, how to listen to them, and some time manipulation of the local Hardhat blockchain.

My next project is provably (See what I did?) going to be a frontend to interact with this lottery. See you soon! :)
